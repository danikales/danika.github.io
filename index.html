        <h1>Hi, I'm Danika!</h1>
        <p>I like to design things!</p>

    <div class="aboutme">
        <p>I'm currently a student in Interactive Arts and Technology at SFU.</p>
        <p>I have interests in 2D and 3D digital designs, as well as </p>
        <p> model-making during my time at SFU.</p>
    </br>
        <p> I have gained many skills and projects from these pervious courses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>IAT 201: human cognition interaction in design</li>
            <li>IAT208: drawing as inquiry</li>
            <li>IAT 235: information design</li>
            <li>IAT 336: materials in design</li>
            
         </ul>
     </br>
         <p>I don't have the best coding skills, but I do love designing!</p>
        <p>I enjoy digital design and modelling in my free time, and spending</p>
        <p>my money and pokemon cards, plushes, and figurines!</p>
        <p>Here is one of my favourite Pokémon SOLOSIS!!</p>
